<h2 id = "divesim"><u>Dive Simulator</u></h2>

<p >In my final year at Babson College I was apart of the Swim and Dive team 
specifically the dive team. With one of the last meets of the year approaching I had a goal 
score I wanted to achieve.
I was worried that I would not get that score so I created a simulation using Python in Jupyter Notebook
to create 10,000 iterations of the meet to see how well I might do. The thing about 
diving as a sport is the scores are calculable. Each diver does 11 dives each with a specific (dd) or
 "diving difficulty."The dd is then followed by a number ex. 2.1, 1.7, 2.2, 3.0 ect.
Each of these dd ratingsare also a multiplier. The middle 3 scores from judges are added 
together and then multiplied by the dd. Usually in small meets there will only be 3 judges so all of their scores count. 
In larger meets there are five to seven judges where only the middle 3
scores are used to avoid bias in either way. In my simulation I used 9 judges and took the middle 3 scores. 
First I ask the user to put in their dive code for example a 103c is a forward(1) 1.5(the third number represents a 1/2
rotation-3) tuck (c). I created a dictionary that autamatically fills in the corresponding difficulty.
The user is then asked to create a range for each dive, their highest and their lowest possible scores.
The simulation runs 10,000 times randomly picking a number between the range for each dive then picking the middle 3 values.
So in 10,000 iterations of any possible combination of scores the final likelyhood of what the final score should be is revealed.

<p> This is Python code done in Jupyter Notebook to record my networth for given stocks at any given point. 
    I am an amateur investor and simply wanted to see if I had sold all of my stocks at their
    most valuable how much would I have made. 
</p>

<p> This first section is me describing the stocks I own for python to use yahoo finance to get stock information.
    I have chosen to omit the dates of when I bought the stock and how much of that stock I bought. I then continue to 
    summarize each stock under the criteria of high and low between two dates I have chosen. That information
    is taken from the table format and just put into individual rows for each stock describing the high and low.
    I also describe the current value of the stock for the current day. I multiply the quantity of stock I bought by
    the highest it has been in a range of dates, the low it has been, and what it is now. In the final section I created a statement
    that says if the stock is net positive it will tell me it has seen returns and if not it will tell me it has not seen returns
    and by just how much it has or has not.

<br>
<p>In this next section I get the difference in days between when I bought the stock and the current day.
    I created a for loop where it loops every day starting at the first day I bought the stock then advances one day ending on the current day.
    Each stock is recorded at its close for the day and then multiplied by the quantity owned for that stock. I add up all the stocks and quantities
    together to get my total net worth each day. That number is appended to a list which is kept recorded.
    The 1170 shows the number of days since I purchased each stock and each number is my net worth per day.

<p>In this section I will show off some of the work I have done in Power BI and the viusalizations that are possible.
    This is not the extent to which I or Power BI is capable but I thought this would be the most interesting and quick example I can give.
    I had previously downloaded a few F1 datasets from kaggle. I beleive they are mostly accurate I am unaware of how the data
    was recorded but it lines up with existing known numbers. For the first few installments I decided to track the rivalry between
    Lewis Hamlton and Max Verstappen as since 2014 they are the onlt two champions execpt in 2016 when there was one other person.
    But in the past 15 years onlt RedBull or Mercedes has won and I included them as well.  
</p>

<img class="image"   src="C:\HTML\max-website\f1visuals\f1visual1.png">
<p>Power BI is capable of showing trends as well geographic data. When I click on the monaco ciruict on the bar chart all the other charts
    filter for monaco and the geographic chart zooms in on that location.

<img class="image"   src="C:\HTML\max-website\f1visuals\f1visual3.png">
<p>This last one is a bit confusing but it shows the avgerage finishing position per year per track for one driver.
    It is being filtered by amount of times finishing at a track and finishing position. For example I zoomed in 
    on monaco 2018 where the fininshing position for Max Verstappen was 9th. He has raced that track 5 times and the color key on top as well
    as zooming in would tell each year.

</div><p>In this section I will show some of the work I have done in sql again this is not the extent of my abilities, this is a 
    quick showcase of a project I worked on. There are over 3-4 dozen different visuals I could have shown with varying information
    and processes. I will keep it to just what I think demonstrates both my and sql's abilities.
</p>

<br>
<p>
This first image is just what I named example3 for easy naming purposes. It shows the name of each person the position they 
finished in for each race, the poisnts they recieved for each race, their starting position and what I called name_year
which is just what I decided was best to combine the year and the race name. It was at first confusing because while the year and name were connected
by a common ID in the dataset it was sometimes difficult to sort them so i decided that it would be best to combine them so now each race is unique.
Each year and race together show up exactly once where as each year and each race separetely appear multiple times.

<br>
<p>The next two sets up images are simila with only minor tweaks I wanted to show who has the most total points ever,
    how many positions they have ever gained how many times they started in the top 10 and how many total races they have completed.
    In the next set I added starts in top 5 and number of years raced which while they do sound very similar show slightly different data.
    While I only sorted the data I am sure there is more to do with it like the ration of wins to total races or ratio of points to positions gained. 
    There are so many I cannot think of them all which sound slike I am dodging a question but really.

<p>The last set of images just shows the total number of poits any individual racer has won at any given track.
    for this example I again chose monaco but I could have chosen any one.
